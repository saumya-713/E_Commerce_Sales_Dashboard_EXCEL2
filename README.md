### Project Tasks

The following tasks will be performed in **Excel** for the **Sales Dashboard**:

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Use the **E-Commerce Dataset** for analysis.
   - Prepare a **Sales and Profit table** month-wise in a working sheet.
   - Prepare a **Region-wise Sales table** in the working sheet.

2. **Data Visualization**:
   - Create a **User Control Combo Box** for selecting the **Product Category**.
   - Build a **Column Chart** for the month-wise and region-wise sales data.
   - Link the data tables to the combo box so the dashboard updates dynamically.

3. **Dashboard Creation**:
   - Design a comprehensive **Sales Dashboard** that allows users to select a product category from the combo box and view the **monthly and regional sales trends** accordingly.

### Tools Required

- **Microsoft Excel**
- **Data Analysis Add-in** (for data analysis and charting)

### Expected Deliverables

- A fully functional **Sales Dashboard** that analyzes sales based on product categories.
- The **mathematical models** (if any) or sales calculations used in the dashboard.
- A **dynamic dashboard** where users can interact by selecting a product category to see trends for sales, profit, and quantity, broken down month-wise and region-wise.
